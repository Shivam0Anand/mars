                    <p>Mars has a large open camping area for tents, vans, small trailers, hexayurts, and other 
                        future themed experimental living units. Base camp has wifi and electricity to charge your 
                        devices. It has screening lounges, closed conference rooms, and quiet working areas. There 
                        are toilets and showers around. As we’re in the desert we ask people to be very frugal with 
                        their water consumption. Water and tank pumping services are available to trailers and larger 
                        camps. There are no blacktop roads or concrete pads. The dirt road is ok to drive on except when 
                        its wet. The rain is infrequent.

                        Bombay Beach has a small market at quaint bar & restaurant. Larger stores like Walmart and Home 
                        Depot are an hour away in Palm Springs or El Centro.

                        Bombay Beach is a mile away and has an active artist community largely oriented around the 
                        Bombay Beach Biennale <a href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/bombaybeachbiennale/">
                        https://instagram.com/explore/<br>tags/bombaybeachbiennale</a> Our sister space 
                        <a href="http://brahma.ai">http://brahma.ai</a> is also in Bombay Beach and has 
                        a lounge and work space Mars campers can visit.
                        <br> What happens on Mars specifically will largely be up to you and the other campers there. 
                        We hope that people organize regular study groups, and video screenings, give workshops, host 
                        talks and generally help make the community a vital interesting place to be. We maintain a 
                        community calendar and a variety of digital communication tools. If you have an idea for an 
                        event just announce it to the group, and let us know if you need to reserve a space for it 
                        or need support in some other way.

                    <p>Camps drive the Mars experience and we push everyone on Mars to participate in one of the 
                    camps.  Camps collectively provide additional infrastructure support to their members, organize 
                    structured learning activities, and host open social gatherings. Mars provides additional services 
                    like water, solar, internet and tank pumping to camps. </p>
