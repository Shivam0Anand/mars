                        <p>Mars has a large open camping area for tents, vans, small trailers, hexayurts, and other 
                            future themed experimental living units. Base camp has wifi and electricity to charge 
                            your devices. It has screening lounges, closed conference rooms, and quiet working areas. 
                            There are toilets and showers around. As we’re in the desert we ask people to be very frugal 
                            with their water consumption. Water and tank pumping services are available to trailers and 
                            larger camps. There are no blacktop roads or concrete pads. The dirt road is ok to drive on 
                            except when its wet. The rain is infrequent.
                            <p>Bombay Beach has a small market at quaint bar & restaurant. Larger stores like Walmart 
                                and Home Depot are an hour away in Palm Springs or El Centro.

                            space http://brahma.ai is also in Bombay Beach and has a lounge and work space Mars campers 
                            can visit.

                        <p>What happens on Mars specifically will largely be up to you and the other campers there. We 
                            hope that people organize regular study groups, and video screenings, give workshops, host 
                            talks and generally help make the community a vital interesting place to be. We maintain a 
                            community calendar and a variety of digital communication tools. If you have an idea for an 
                            event just announce it to the group, and let us know if you need to reserve a space for it 
                            or need support in some other way.

                            the camps.  Camps collectively provide additional infrastructure support to their members, 
                            organize structured learning activities, and host open social gatherings. Mars provides additional 
                            services like water, solar, internet and tank pumping to camps.

                            <br>Burningman has been an amazing experience for many people living in the desert,

                            The Mars Project attempts to maintain this type of vitality from January through
